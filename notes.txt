===================
Logic 

    1. load page
    2. loop through links to load link urls
    3. for each restaurant page, loop through items


Solutions

    1. keep everything as is, but return result of the loop function that creates the response obj, so that gets passed to original axios .then
        - make initial axios call
        - in that .then, loop through links
        - for each link, load that html and loop through items
    
    2. the only resolve should be in the inner loop

    3. the only promise is where the second axios call is

    2. Promise.all
        - when looping through each item per restaurant, after loop, resolve the result of the .filter, so it should resolve {restaurant: [{...}, {...}]}
        - use a Promise.all the resolve an array like [{rest: [{...}]}, {rest2: [{...}]}]
        - flatten that array to create one large obj, which will be your answer
    
    3. Async/Await
        --------------------------
        - await for your data when you make the axios call -> const data = await axios.get('url');
        - once you have that data, return it so the next .then can use
        - put the async in a try block and have a catch to handle error
        - that next .then can use that data to do its logic, and add to global result object
        --------------------------
        - just set the result to await the grand answer
        - getScrapeService: async function() {
            const answerToReturn = await mainFunction()

            const mainFunction = () => {
                [all the logic, which you want to return the grand answer]
            }

        }
